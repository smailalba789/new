    <article> <p>Nutrition is the study of nutrients in food, how the
         body uses them, and the relationship between diet, 
        health, and disease. Nutritionists use ideas 
        from molecular biology, 
        biochemistry, and genetics to understand 
        how nutrients affect the human body.</p>

          New York City is made up of five boroughs which include Queens, Manhattan, Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Staten Island. The city is the home of approximately 8 million people. In 1876, France gifted the City of New York what is known as the Statue of Liberty, which is currently located on Ellis Island commonly visited by tourists. However, it took 10 years to assemble and therefore wasnâ€™t unveiled until 1886. Another tourist destination is Times Square. Times Square is commonly known for the big buildings, Broadway shows, and bright neon signs. This famous location was named after The New York Times after the Times moved to that location. Prior to that, it was named Longacre Square. New York City is also known for its bridges that connect the boroughs and allow ease of transportation.

    our health, and several studies particularly in model organisms and rodents have shown that nutrition has also the potential to increase lifespan.</p>
